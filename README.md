Khepri Forge is an open-source back-office platform for creating, managing, and renewing virtual worlds within the Numinia metaverse.

## 🌅 The Legend of Khepri

In ancient times, the scarab god **Khepri** rolled the sun across the sky each dawn, symbolizing eternal renewal and transformation. Just as Khepri brought light to each new day, this forge brings life to virtual worlds—rolling them into existence, nurturing their growth, and guiding their evolution.

**Khepri Forge** is the sacred tool entrusted to the **Oracles of Numinia**—the chosen few who possess the wisdom and power to shape reality itself. Through this mystical interface, Oracles command the creation, management, and renewal of countless virtual worlds within the Numinia metaverse.

## ⚡ The Oracle's Power

The Forge grants the Oracles dominion over the fundamental aspects of world creation:

### 🌍 **World Genesis**

Channel the primordial forces to manifest new realms—each with its own essence, purpose, and destiny. Like clay on the potter's wheel, worlds take shape under the Oracle's watchful eye.

### 🔮 **Realm Monitoring**

Peer through the veil of reality to observe the vital signs of each world—the flow of energy through its servers, the pulse of players within its boundaries, the health of its infrastructure.

### 🛡️ **Guardian Protocols**

Protect the sacred forge with layers of mystical wards—authentication rituals, access hieroglyphs, and protective seals that ensure only worthy Oracles may enter.

### 📜 **The Eternal Record**

Every action, every decision, every world birthed or renewed is inscribed in the imperishable ledger—a chronicle that spans beyond time itself.
